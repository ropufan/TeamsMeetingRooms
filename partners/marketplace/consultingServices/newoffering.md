# Step 1: Creating a new offer

We will start creating a new offer by clicking on the `+ New offer` button and selecting `Consulting Services`. A panel will show from the right side, and you will need to complete the fields that will be displayed. Please note that the `Offer ID` and `Offer Alias` defined here will be used internally in Partner Center and will not be visible to customers - it is recommended to use a naming convention that will help you identify the offer later on.

Offer Alias: `Teams Meeting Rooms: 1-day Assessment`

## Next Steps

The next step that you will need to take is to enter the offering and [establish the CRM setup](offersetup.md)
