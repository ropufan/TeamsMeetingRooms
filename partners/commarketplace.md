Microsoft's commercial marketplace is a vibrant platform that empowers partners to showcase and sell their innovative solutions worldwide. It connects partners with millions of customers, from enterprises to small businesses and government organizations. With a wide range of categories, partners can tap into Microsoft's ecosystem and integrate with popular products like Azure and Office 365. Joining the marketplace provides access to marketing support, technical guidance, and analytics, helping partners scale their businesses and make a meaningful impact.

## `⚒️` Consulting Services

Partners' consulting services in collaboration with Microsoft offer expert guidance for businesses embarking on digital transformation. With deep industry knowledge and technical expertise, these partners provide tailored solutions to enhance operational efficiency, productivity, and unlock new opportunities. From strategy development to implementation and optimization, partners work closely with organizations to navigate complexities and drive long-term success in the ever-evolving business landscape. Together with Microsoft's resources and technologies, these consulting services empower businesses to achieve their digital transformation goals effectively.

**Consulting Services** themselves are of 5 types:

- **Assessment**: An evaluation of a customer's environment to determine the applicability of a solution and to estimate the cost and timeline of its implementation.
- **Briefing**: An introduction to a solution or a service using frameworks, demos, and customer examples.
- **Implementation**: A complete installation that results in a fully working solution.
- **Proof of concept**: A limited-scope implementation to determine whether a solution meets the customer's requirements.
- **Workshop**: An interactive engagement conducted on the customer's premises. It can involve training, briefings, assessments, or demos built on the customer's data or environment.

> **Warning**  
> Each published offering will need to belong to one of these categories, and should be included in the name of the offering.  
> This is an important aspect to decide upon, when starting to sketch a new Consulting Services offering.
