## Consulting Services `⚒️`

Partners' consulting services in collaboration with Microsoft offer expert guidance for businesses embarking on digital transformation. With deep industry knowledge and technical expertise, these partners provide tailored solutions to enhance operational efficiency, productivity, and unlock new opportunities. From strategy development to implementation and optimization, partners work closely with organizations to navigate complexities and drive long-term success in the ever-evolving business landscape. Together with Microsoft's resources and technologies, these consulting services empower businesses to achieve their digital transformation goals effectively.

The **Consulting Services** category encompasses five types:

**Assessment**: An evaluation of a customer's environment to determine the applicability of a solution and estimate the cost and timeline of its implementation.
**Briefing**: An introduction to a solution or service using frameworks, demos, and customer examples.
**Implementation**: A complete installation that results in a fully working solution.
**Proof of Concept**: A limited-scope implementation to determine whether a solution meets the customer's requirements.
**Workshop**: An interactive engagement conducted on the customer's premises. It can involve training, briefings, assessments, or demos built on the customer's data or environment.

> **Warning** Each published offering must belong to one of these categories and should be included in the offering's name.  
> This is a crucial aspect to consider when creating a new Consulting Services offering.
