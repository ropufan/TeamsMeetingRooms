Being integrated into a Focus Room, we recommend adding a touchscreen enabled monitor into the room and connect it to the A10. This way, the controlling part of the Meeting Room will be handled directly on the monitor. Otherwise, we recommend adding a CTP18 Touch Panel for meeting control directly on the meeting table. THe CTP18 Touch Panel is described below.
